# [Foundation for Emails](https://foundation.zurb.com/emails)

Foundation for Emails (previously known as Ink) is a framework for creating responsive HTML emails that work in any email client &mdash; even Outlook. Our HTML/CSS components have been tested across every major email client to ensure consistency. And with the [Inky](https://github.com/zurb/inky) templating language, writing HTML emails is now even easier.

## Sass/CSS-only Package

This fork contains only the Sass source files and pre-built CSS files to facilitate lightweight inclusion in a customized build of  **foundation-emails-template**.

## Building

Run `npm run build` to compile the main `scss/foundation-emails.scss` file to CSS and minified CSS (with source maps), which will be placed in the `dist` folder. Assumes that the `sass` binary is available on the system; it is not provided in the current dependencies of this project.

## Contributing

As an open source project, we looooove our community support. Please file issues, or better yet pull requests on the [Foundation for Emails Repo](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-emails). We're stoked to hear your feedback, make improvements, and keep evolving Foundation for Emails!
